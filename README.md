# JT & Co.

In this project, the aim was to build a static front-end site that presented useful information to the users whilst using all the technologies I have learned. I feel I have accomplished this and more when I had also incorporated something that wasn’t taught and successfully found out how to do it myself through.
When I started the course to become a fullstack web developer, I had spoken to a friend of mine about building a website for his company. As soon as this first milestone project was set, I was able to consistently converse with JT & Co to gather helpful resources, imagery and text I could incorporate to the site, with the intention of making it as genuine as possible.
JT & Co is a thriving property development and maintenance company based in London. With his permission, I was able to take all the information he had provided to design a modern website to match his contemporary business. He and I had similar ideas where the customer could access the site and have no difficulties seeing what work he produces and how to get in touch with a click of a button.


## UX
***

Shown in the photograph of JT & Co’s leaflet, a simple yet tasteful colour scheme is noticeable. It’s not too overwhelming on the eyes nor does it lack attention to detail. I wanted to keep the colour scheme of yellow and grey consistent for customers to recognise his branding. The site also included his logo, however rather than positioning it at the centre, it’s to the left of the page.

My main goal with this is to support local businesses like JT & Co. I think the personal text at the bottom about having a cup of tea shows how customer orientated they are. I wanted the site to be manageable for customers who are looking for a range of jobs from flooring to rebuilding a bathroom. JT & Co sent a range images of their portfolio to include on the site.

I want to create the site to be as user friendly as possible but not too complicated for customers. i want to create a site where customers can easily get the information they want and contact JT. As i mentioned before the main focs is to gain JT aditional buisness and thats the main aim of this site.

## Features
***
Like the company, the features of the website are all simple yet tasteful with easy to understand concepts such as icons, no overwhelming paragraphs of text and imagery. The home section was to give a brief summary of what JT & Co can do. I decided that by including icons, this was a successful way to make the website break down a lot of text and signify what work they can produce. A very brief summary of what the company can do is included beneath the icons to make the site more streamlines and easier to read. The colour of the text was taken strongly into consideration as I wanted to swap the colours from block to text.

A main source of inspiration for the website was from ‘Putting it all together/ Mini project with Bootstrap4’. I included the link for the navbar in my own work but manipulated it to suit the website I was designing for JT & Co. I reduced it to just 3 links oppose to the 4 and made it fit the full length of the screen. I really liked the way it was laid out before and it fitted the criteria I wanted for the site: easy, modern and straight forward for all to look at and appreciate. In the end, I was able to put my own mark on it once I included the helpful link.

In the gallery, I included a variety of imagery sent directly from JT & Co’s camera of before and after photographs of work they have done. This is to give the customers insight of his ability and potential, hoping the customer likes what they produce and get in touch. I didn’t want to over-do it with photographs of their work as I felt too many will lose the interest of those looking. I wanted to keep like theme of the website, simple and tasteful. The order of imagery is the same as the home page keeping it consistent and easy to understand.

I also drew inspiration from the contact page of “Putting it all together/ Mini project with Bootstrap4”. Again, I really liked the way that a customer could send a brief and quick message to the client about the work they wanted doing. I wanted to change it a bit and add a bit more detail to it and keep with the colour theme the client had asked for.

I drew inspiration from the content page of ‘putting it all together/Mini project with Bootstrap4’. Again, I really appreciated the way a customer could send an email directly from a device with their email saved onto it. The idea of the customer being able to be in touch in such a straightforward way is really reassuring that they want it to be hassle-free as possible. I wanted to change it a bit by adding more detail such as additional contact information and a direct question ask what they would like done rather than describing the project like before. The colour scheme is still consistent with the rest of the site, with plenty of negative space in the background keeping it simple and tasteful, not overtop and overcrowded.

The page I am most please with is the contact page. I had explained to JT & Co that I wanted to create a page where the customer was able to easily and quickly send a brief summary of the job that was needed straight to their email address, not a middleman. There is a calendar feature included also that has the option of still sending an email, even if they are unsure of when they would like the job to begin. The ‘How can we help?’ title is placed above a box that would request the customer to put in their name, email address and phone number so the client can be in touch with them in alternative ways. I think that by giving them the option to do either, it’s meeting their needs more if they would prefer a conversation via telephone or email. It is important that customers can be in touch with the company.

The header I included has a quick and fast link to their phone number and email address. In this instance, I included my own as reference. Regarding the email address, I investigated how to make the link work so that when it was clicked on, it would automatically bring up their saved information. I used Malito href tag. I have not been shown how to do this however with initiative, research and conversations with tutors, I was able to set it up and I am very pleased with the result.

The footer includes a link to his social media pages for JT & Co’s company. I used ‘Putting it all together/ Mini project with Bootstrap 4’ as a reference on how to set up the social media links to promote his business further. I had again tried to style it to the client’s colour specification. Now, they do not have social media platforms for their business, but I wanted to include it anyway to show the intention I had in mind for the website to incorporate his online portfolios. Social media helps you build brand awareness, I wanted this to be included along with their quote displayed on their leaflet, promoting their work ethos.

There are a few features I wanted to implement however once I learn more about jQuery and JavaScript, I will incorporate them more. I had the intention of creating a carousel link for the photographs displayed in the gallery however despite the many attempts I had made for it to be successful, It was very difficult due to my lack of understanding so instead they’re presented in a neat and tidy fashion.

## Technologies Used
***

Here's a short summary of the technoligies i used and what they were used for.

-This project uses HTML and CSS programming languages

-https://getbootstrap.com/

Bootstrap was used to help format the whole site. It was used for grids from the galley photos to the layout of the header and footer

-https://fontawesome.com/

I used font awesome for the excellent icons and for the different fonts that i used throughout my site

-https://validator.w3.org/

This project used the HTML Validator to check all coding 


## Testing
***
As i stated in the UX, i wanted to make this website as user friendly as possible and easy for customers to follow. i feel i have done this and made thr site easy to follow and nice to work with.

I created a simple layout for the navigation on the site. i wanted 3 easy, simple headings to the page; Home, Gallery and Contact. The navigation is simple to follow. Each heading will take you to the corresponding page. And I tried to use nice simople icons with this to make it flow nicely and seem more familiar to the user.

On the header for each page it also shows the buisness emal and phone number. I made the email address a link so that once you click on it, it takes you straight to your emails. I did this using the Malito link. if you click on it then it would take you to your own emails and a ready to send email for Jt would be there, and any additional information ready to be inputted.

On the Gallery page it has photographs of Jts work and showcases them all neatly into 5 seperate headings. I created each image so that it can be enlarged when clicked on, and it will also take you to a new tab on you browser so you dont loose the main site. This is important as you dont want the customer to loose the company site and maybe look elsewear.

On the contact page i made "How can we help?" section. In this section i made a form. In this form i added "contact name, email address. phone number and a breif description of what they would like done". Each section has to be filled out before the form can be submitted. If any of these are not filled out it will come up with an error asking the field to be filled out before it can be submitted. i have added a submit my quote button that would 

The footer section has links to many social media accounts. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest and Linked-in. Now as JT hasnt actually got any social media for hsi company. This is because hes a relatively new company, so what i did was i made all the social media links go to the home page. They do the same as on the Gallery, and that they take you to a sperate page and dont loose the main site.
